Work in progress/Simon practicing Rust, use at own risk

Finds all the obsidian links \[\[\]\] in folder X and then adds queries to those in the end of zettlekasten files.

"---
# References
....
EOF"

Also add resources\folders.txt containing
"# Key:Value
Litterature:Path_to_litterature_folder
Zettelkasten:Path_to_zettlekasten_folder
